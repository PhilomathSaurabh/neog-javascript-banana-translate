    <li>Name - Talk bananaa</li>
    <li>initially JS was only on browser with Node.js started using it in the server</li>
    <li>How to attach elements in the browser</li>
    <li>Most of the apps are GUI - Graphical User Interface APP</li>
    <li>how to do network call, GUI Selector</li>
    <li>what to do when something fails.</li>
    <li>Dont code right now, rather code later.</li>
    <li class="imp">You would need postman to check. </li>
    <li>Do initial commit and publish the html</li>
    <li class="imp">learn to use script tag to use javascript</li>
    <li>Check that script is working in the console of browser</li>
    <li>another approach is you can use a javascript file - App.js</li>
    <li>in the app.js you can write console.log"" and you will have that in the browser console</li>
    <li><a href="https://neog.camp/guide/lesson-four">Do as is given in this weblink - proceed step by step</a></li>
    <li>Just searched for multilevel listing for html and got an appraoch. Will be using this from now onwards.</li>
    <li>idea is to use ul inside li and then use li inside ul hehhehe... I will show example
      <ul>
        <li>This is a list inside the list </li>
        <li>This is next level isnide the same list</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Now the same upper level will continue, lets try it out</li>
    <li>Awesome it worked!!!</li>

  <h3>Creating multi-level notes</h3>
  <p> from now Onwards - finally now notes could be more structured :P</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Using Prompts to take username
      <ul>
        <li>Very less people use this!</li>
        <li>YOu can promot and ask for give me username</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>alert the user with the username entered
      <ul>
        <li>Hello +username</li>
        <li>dont forget to enter the username in a variable.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>This is the simplest program to write in javascript</li>
    <li>Input, output and processing, YEEEE - Finally you have a mini program</li>
    <li>What is Vanila.js?
      <ul>
        <li>there were many times that many things didnt used to work on multiple browsers, javascript caused browser
          incompatibalities so a genetic system was to be developed</li>
        <li>people started using jquery to overcome the issue.</li>
        <li>All browser companies came together to implement a common standards</li>
        <li>JS is not from a single company, now you can do a lot of stuff without using jQuery</li>
        <li class="imp">developers are asked to know stuff without using FRAMEWORKS</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <span class="imp">Microsoft web developer code round</span> 
      <ul>
        <li>Make your own outlook and make sure not use any framework, not even jquery
        </li>
        <li>I was able to crack and created, its good to know Vanila.js to create apps.</li>
        <li>you can make all the apps with react but when you want to enter a good company you have to do problems in
          Vanila.js, you are checked against your understanding. DONT BE A FRAMEWORK DEPENDENT GUY!!</li>
        <li>Take more notes and publish app out of it.</li>
        <li>Vanila.js is very imp for understandings and cracking high level jobs</li>
        <li>I was going to leave the coding round, but there I started learning in those 5 - 6 hours</li>
        <li>Company asked that I was not able to solve very easily!!</li>
        <li>I wrote my own react, redux and react-router</li>
        <li>I can make any app if I can have those in my hands</li>
        <li>I coded my own version of react, redux and routers</li>
        <li class="imp">Then using all those I programmed the whole thing</li>
        <li>Code was very clean and because of that I was hired.</li>
        <li>use good function names, good coding conventions</li>
        <li>Every small detail would be covered in the levelONE</li>
        <li>6 hours I coded and finally did it!!!</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>


  <h3>Back to class</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>When HTML is being rendered it goes from top to bottom, so put the script at the bottom</li>
    <li>Create a button in the JS</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Button tag to be used to click button</li>
      <li>give button id and name the button</li>
      <li class="imp">do all of it in the index.html :P</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Variable to store refernece and use query selector
      <ul>
        <li>use #btn-translate</li>
        <li>store the btn as global variable in the console of chrome and change color to red</li>
        <li>DOM elements and interactions</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Btn - event listner
      <ul>
        <li>.addEventlistener - do this function on click</li>
        <li>console.log - clikced!!</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>How does query selector works internally
      <ul>
        <li>go to google.com</li>
        <li>document.body - try this on chrome browser</li>
        <li class="imp">change the background color as green :P</li>
        <li>every time you do a queryselector - it goes in the document, gets the element with id and gives the button back</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is an API
      <ul>
        <li>CLI is command line interface - you talk to program via command line</li>
        <li>GUI - Graphical user interfcae - user is talking to program via graphics</li>
        <li>API is Application Programming Interface</li>
        <ul>
          <li>When you have to programm an application, you will have to create an API</li>
          <li>When you go to google.com and want to talk to a program, as a dev you talk with APIs</li>
          <li>there are thousands of APIs which you can use to talk to programs, add event listener API can be used to add event. </li>
          <li>You need APIs to talk to multiple programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>multiple events are there - eg scroll, hover etc. </li>
        <li class="imp">browser events - javascript.info, Read the book eloquentJavascript.net</li>
        <li><a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">This is good book to udnerstand js</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

        <li>create textarea, give styling to text area</li>
        <li>add placeholder</li>
        <li>give some padding</li>
        <li class="imp">what is difference bw padding, margin?</li>
        <li>give id to the text area</li>
        <li>read the element with .value - this works with the <span class="imp">form element</span></li>
        <li><span><span class="imp">Surround with tag used - searched for shortcut its Ctrl+Shift+P and write tag name> and class name </span></span>- SIMPLE!!</li>
        <li>get Data, console.log the data</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Every inputtext and all ids are created as objects. These are called <span class="imp">DOM - Document Object Model</span></li>
    <ul>
      <li>DOM models the entire document as an object. To acess methods we have to use document.(methods)</li>
      <li>We can put our own functionality in the callbacks</li>
      <li>What is DOM??</li>
      <li>Check the mdn doc for reference about the CSS selectors</li>
      <li>Function which goes inside another function is <span class="imp">called callback</span>. THis is not same in all cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Spend more times on learnings, watch the videos 2-3 times and understand better</li>
